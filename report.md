üëã **ademisler - let‚Äôs improve your plugin!**

Thank you for submitting your plugin, "ASA AI Sales Agent". The Plugin Review Team volunteers are actively working through the queue. We are a group of volunteers who help you identify common issues so that you can make your plugin more secure, compatible, reliable and compliant with the guidelines.

Before your plugin reaches a human reviewer, our automated tools ‚Äî which help the team handle around 1,000 plugin reviews per week ‚Äî have flagged a few potential issues that you may need to address. To avoid delays and help streamline the manual review process, we‚Äôve temporarily paused your submission to give you a chance to review and fix these common issues.

> ü§ñ This is an automated message generated using a combination of algorithms and AI. It hasn‚Äôt necessarily been reviewed by a human. Its purpose is to help you resolve potential common issues early, before manual review begins.

**What you need to do:**
*   Carefully review the flagged issues and address any that apply to your case.
*   Follow the steps listed at the end of this email, including replying to this email.
*   Your plugin will be added directly to a manual review queue managed by one of our volunteers.

**Details regarding the review process queue:**
*   For consistency and better communication, your plugin review will be assigned to a single volunteer who will assist you throughout the entire review. However, response times may vary depending on how much time the volunteer is able to contribute to the team and if whether they need to consult something with the rest of the team.
*   **Meaningful improvements = faster reviews:** Plugins that show clear progress regarding flagged issues will be reviewed faster.
*   **Fewer review cycles = faster approval:** Plugins needing only one or two rounds of review often get approved in days. But if multiple rounds are needed, the wait time between them can increase significantly ‚Äî sometimes weeks or even months.

**Tips to speed things up**
*   Thoroughly identify and fix all identified issues before resubmitting. The more complete your fixes, the faster the review will be and the fewer review cycles it will need.
*   Take the time to test and review your plugin before re-uploading. Rushed updates often introduce new issues. Reviewers, like anyone else, aren‚Äôt thrilled to see the same issue again or even fatal errors during activation.

This process is designed to help you improve your plugin while making the review experience faster and more efficient for everyone.

### Have you read the guidelines and this plugin complies with them?

Please confirm that you have read and complied with the WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guidelines.

In particular, but not limited to, please check the following:
*   Plugins are permitted to require the use of third party/external services. The service itself must provide functionality of substance and be clearly documented (what the service is and what is used for + what data is sent and when + links to privacy and service terms) in the readme file submitted with the plugin. (Guideline 6)
*   Your plugin may not embed external links or credits on the public site without explicit user permission. (Guideline 10)

### Have you checked for common technical issues?

Please ensure that your plugin adheres to best practices, including the following:

üî¥ **Use Prefixes for declarations, globals and stored data**

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Why it matters:** Prefixing avoid naming collisions with other themes, plugins, or WordPress core functions.
A prefix is a string placed in front of a name to avoid collisions. It must be at least 4 characters long, feel distinct and unique to the plugin (do not use common words), and be separated by an underscore or dash.
Please check the official WordPress docs on avoiding name collisions.

üîç **Identify not prefixed names:** Look for any name that is used in a place where it can create a collision.

| Type of element | Affected elements |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Declarations** | Functions, classes, etc (if not under a namespace) |
| **Globals** | Global variables, namespaces, `define()` . |
| **Data storage** | `update_option()` , `set_transient()` , `update_post_meta()` , etc. |
| **WordPress declarations** | `add_shortcode()` , `register_post_type()` , `add_menu_page()` , `wp_register_script()` , `wp_localize_script()` , etc. |

If the defined name for that is not prefixed, that‚Äôs a potential issue! üïµÔ∏è

üõ† **Fix it:** Always prefix those names, for example if your plugin is called "ASA AI Sales Agent" then you could use names like these:
```php
function asaaisaa_save_post(){ ... }
class ASAAISAA_Admin { ... }
update_option( 'asaaisaa_options', $options );
register_setting( 'asaaisaa_settings', 'asaaisaa_user_id', ... );
define( 'ASAAISAA_PLUGIN_DIR', plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) );
global $asaaisaa_options;
namespace ademisler\asaaisalesagent;
```

### Other details

We've detected some other details that you may want to check.

#### Out of Date Libraries

At least one of the 3rd party libraries you're using is out of date. Please upgrade to the latest stable version for better support and security. We do not recommend you use beta releases.

From your plugin:
```
assets/js/dompurify.min.js:1 üî¥ @license DOMPurify 2.4.1
# ‚Ü≥ Possible URL: https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify
```

#### Allowing Direct File Access to plugin files

Direct file access occurs when someone directly queries a PHP file. This can be done by entering the complete path to the file in the browser's URL bar or by sending a POST request directly to the file.

For files that only contain class or function definitions, the risk of something funky happening when accessed directly is minimal. However, for files that contain executable code (e.g., function calls, class instance creation, class method calls, or inclusion of other PHP files), the risk of security issues is hard to predict because it depends on the specific case, but it can exist and it can be high.

You can easily prevent this by adding the following code at the beginning of all PHP files that could potentially execute code if accessed directly:
```php
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit; // Exit if accessed directly
```
Add it after the `<?php` opening tag and after the `namespace` declaration, if any, but before any other code.

Example(s) from your plugin:
`asa-ai-sales-agent.php:16`

### üëâ Your next steps

This is your checklist:
*   Have you read the guidelines and this plugin complies with them?
*   Have you checked for common technical issues?
*   Other details

If there is something that needs to be fixed, please take your time, fix it and update your plugin files at the "Add your plugin" page, while being logged in with your account "ademisler".

If after checking the list and do the changes you feel that everything is right or need further clarification, please reply to this email and a volunteer will assist you.

If you believe there is a requirement you cannot accomplish and choose not to make changes, your plugin submission will be rejected after three months.

Thanks!

By taking these steps, you're helping the Plugin Review Team work more efficiently ‚Äî meaning your plugin (along with the thousands of others in the queue) can be reviewed faster. üöÄ We really appreciate your contribution!

### Disclaimers

*   If, at any time during the review process, you wish to change your permalink (aka the plugin slug) "asa-ai-sales-agent", you must explicitly and clearly tell us what you would like it to be. Just changing it in your code and in the display name is not sufficient. Remember, permalinks cannot be altered after approval.
*   This email was partially auto-generated, so please be aware that some information might not be entirely accurate. No personal data was shared with the AI during this process. If you notice any obvious errors or something seems off, feel free to reply ‚Äî we‚Äôll be happy to take a closer look and readjust this automation.
